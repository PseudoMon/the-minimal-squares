# The Minimal Squares

The Minimal Squares is a minimalist design for a simple blog or blog-like site. It's made with simple HTML and CSS, with some responsive grid courtesy of [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) and some icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io), with the files included. This repo only contains the basic template for a site, and as such, not immediately usable. 

If you want to use this theme for your site, please contact [me](http://pseudomon.github.io) beforehand. I'd be glad to help setting it up.
